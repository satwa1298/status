# status

A simple project where users can set their status and view the status of others through a widget on their phone. Users are able to set their status to the default Available, Away, and Busy statuses, as well as create their own custom statuses. Users can also add and remove friends, and all added friends can see a user's current status. 
This is the backend of the project, providing API endpoints for fetching and updating user statuses, along with CRUD operations for custom statuses and friends list management.
